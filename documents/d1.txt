Temperatures at my farm today are expected to reach 80-degrees Fahrenheit - unseasonably warm, but great for continuing our planting projects in my living maze.

Last week, my gardeners and outdoor grounds crew started working on another big section of this garden. I designed an area that includes a long boxwood border across the maze and an all√©e running perpendicular to it leading to a small, open space. Yesterday, the sod was removed, a trench was dug, and 52 boxwood shrubs were planted - it's coming along very nicely.
