Frozen scallion pancakes, man. Wow. Add some eggs, some spinach, avocado and chili crisp, and it’s a 5 minute meal that I’ve come to rely on SO HEAVILY over the last few months.

Scallion pancakes are a part of Asian cuisine – many think they originated in China, and the ones I buy from Trader Joe’s are branded as Taiwanese Green Onion Pancakes. When I was reading about ways to cook them on Reddit, I came across several posts from people recalling when their Chinese or Taiwanese parents cooked these for them as kids – fried scrambly egg stuck to the back side, rolled up and served with a simple sauce. Then a few months ago, I saw a video posted by the Woks of Life that shows this same thing – the pancake, the egg, and wait wait wait – THE AVOCADO.
