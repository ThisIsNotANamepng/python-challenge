# Python Challenge

---

- This challenge will incorporte skills learned at our previous event "Introduction to Python".
- We will also formally introduce classes in Python and utilize them to develop an application/command line tool, to interact with text documents.

---

### This challenge will require students to do the following:
1. Implement code to read/write to text documents.
2. Create classes to effectively manage and manipulate documents.
3. Develop a script to allow a user to create/read/update/delete documents (using the classes and their methods as an interface).

### Skill incorported include:
1. String manipulation
2. File IO
3. Class creation and utilization
4. Inheritance

### Elements
- Exstensibility
  - When creating the cli functionality, have students create options based on the exisiting function names, rather than hard coding.
  - Students should be able to add an additional document type (via inheritance) if they so desire.
    
- Classes
  - Inheritance should be used for the document-esque classes.
  - Magic methods should be defined when appropriate.
    
- Readability
  - Student's code should be neat, readable, and contain informative comments.
